We experimentally demonstrate quantum walks of one and two strongly correlated microwave photons in a ID array of 12 superconducting qubits with short-range interactions. First, in one-photon quantum walks, we observed the propagation of the density and correlation of the quasi particle excitation of the superconducting qubit, and quantum entanglement between qubit pairs. Second, when implementing two-photon quantum walks by exciting two superconducting qubits, we observed the fermionization of strongly interacting photons from the measured time-dependent long-range anticorrelations, representing the antibunching of photons with attractive interactions. The demonstration of quantum walks on a quantum processor, using superconducting qubits as artificial atoms and tomographic readout, paves the way to quantum simulation of many-body phenomena and universal quantum computation.},

Here in experiments, we construct a Bose-Hubbard ladder with a ladder array of 20 qubits on a 24-qubit superconducting processor. We investigate theoretically and demonstrate experimentally the dynamics of single- and double-excitation states with distinct behaviors, indicating the uniqueness of the Bose-Hubbard ladder. We observe the linear propagation of photons in the single-excitation case, satisfying the Lieb-Robinson bounds. The double-excitation state, initially placed at the edge, localizes; while placed in the bulk, it splits into two single-excitation modes spreading linearly toward two boundaries, respectively. Remarkably, these phenomena, studied both theoretically and numerically as unique properties of the Bose-Hubbard ladder, are represented coherently by pairs of controllable qubits in experiments. Our results show that collective excitations, as a single mode, are not free. This work paves the way to simulation of exotic logic particles by subtly encoding physical qubits and exploration of rich physics by superconducting circuits.},

Here we investigate phenomena related to localized states associated with a flat band supported by the sawtooth geometry. A localization-delocalization transition emerges in the noninteracting regime as the sign of hopping coefficient is changed. In the presence of interactions, patterns of localized states approach a uniform density distribution for repulsive interactions while interesting localized density patterns can arise in a strongly attractive regime. The density patterns indicate the underlying inhomogeneity of the simulator. Two-particle correlations can further distinguish the nature of the localized states in attractive and repulsive interaction regimes. We also survey possible experimental implementations of the simulator.},

Our cooling protocol preserves the particle number - realizing a canonical ensemble - and also affords the efficient preparation of dark states which, due to symmetry, cannot be prepared via coherent drives on the cavity.

@article{Ma2019,
	abstract = {Superconducting circuits are a competitive platform for quantum computation because they offer controllability, long coherence times and strong interactions—properties that are essential for the study of quantum materials comprising microwave photons. However, intrinsic photon losses in these circuits hinder the realization of quantum many-body phases. Here we use superconducting circuits to explore strongly correlated quantum matter by building a Bose–Hubbard lattice for photons in the strongly interacting regime. We develop a versatile method for dissipative preparation of incompressible many-body phases through reservoir engineering and apply it to our system to stabilize a Mott insulator of photons against losses. Site- and time-resolved readout of the lattice allows us to investigate the microscopic details of the thermalization process through the dynamics of defect propagation and removal in the Mott phase. Our experiments demonstrate the power of superconducting circuits for studying strongly correlated matter in both coherent and engineered dissipative settings. In conjunction with recently demonstrated superconducting microwave Chern insulators, we expect that our approach will enable the exploration of topologically ordered phases of matter.},

@article{Orell2019,
	abstract = {Chains of superconducting circuit devices provide a natural platform for studies of synthetic bosonic quantum matter. Motivated by the recent experimental progress in realizing disordered and interacting chains of superconducting transmon devices, we study the bosonic many-body localization phase transition using the methods of exact diagonalization as well as matrix product state dynamics. We estimate the location of transition separating the ergodic and the many-body localized phases as a function of the disorder strength and the many-body on-site interaction strength. The main difference between the bosonic model realized by superconducting circuits and similar fermionic model is that the effect of the on-site interaction is stronger due to the possibility of multiple excitations occupying the same site. The phase transition is found to be robust upon including longer-range hopping and interaction terms present in the experiments. Furthermore, we calculate experimentally relevant local observables and show that their temporal fluctuations can be used to distinguish between the dynamics of Anderson insulator, many-body localization, and delocalized phases. While we consider unitary dynamics, neglecting the effects of dissipation, decoherence, and measurement back action, the timescales on which the dynamics is unitary are sufficient for observation of characteristic dynamics in the many-body localized phase. Moreover, the experimentally available disorder strength and interactions allow for tuning the many-body localization phase transition, thus making the arrays of superconducting circuit devices a promising platform for exploring localization physics and phase transition.},
